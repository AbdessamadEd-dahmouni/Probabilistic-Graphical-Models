# Probabilistic Graphical Models
Assignments for the Probabilistic Graphical Models course from MVA

This repository contains my work for the three assignements of this course:

* Assignment 1
    * Implement Linear Discriminant Analysis
    * Implement Logistic Regression using IRLS algorithm
    * Implement Linear Regression
    * Implement Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

* Assignment 2
    * Implement K-Means with random initialization
    * Implement Gaussian Mixture Model using EM algorithm for the isotropic case
    * Implement Gaussian Mixture Model using EM algorithm for the general case

* Assignment 3
    * Implement the EM algorithm for HMM: sum-product algorithm and parameters estimation.
    * Implement Viterbi algorithm for MAP inference.
